DISCO FEVER EVENT - Thanos Infection

HOW TO TRIGGER THE EVENT:
Click anywhere on the world with your mouse. This will trigger the disco fever event at the clicked location.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE EVENT IS TRIGGERED:
1. A 3x3 area of purple "infected" background tiles appears centered on the click location
2. Thanos spawns at the center of the clicked location (if not occupied)
3. Any dudes currently standing on the newly infected tiles immediately transform into infected dudes

WHAT THE AFFECTED ENTITIES (DUDES) DO:
- When dudes walk over infected purple tiles, they transform into infected dudes (DudeInfected)
- Infected dudes are still fundamentally Dudes but with modified behavior and appearance
- Infected dudes have 2x speed (half the action and animation periods)
- Infected dudes move randomly around the world instead of seeking trees/houses
- When infected dudes stand on infected tiles, they can transform nearby normal dudes into more infected dudes

WHAT THE NEW ENTITY (THANOS) IS AND HOW IT BEHAVES:
- Thanos is a purple and gold entity that moves randomly around the world
- Wherever Thanos walks, he infects the background tile, turning it purple
- Thanos automatically transforms any nearby normal dudes (within 3 tiles) into infected dudes
- Thanos moves in random directions (up, down, left, right) each turn
- Thanos continues to spread the infection and transform dudes as he moves

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Used DudeInfected class that extends Dude to modify existing entities rather than create entirely new entity types
- This follows the assignment requirement to "affect existing mobile entities" by transformation
- Infected dudes still inherit from Dude but override behavior methods (executeActivity, moveTo, transform)
- Used alien sprite images for infected dudes to show visual transformation while maintaining Dude inheritance
- Made infected dudes have 2x speed to make the infection spread faster and more dramatically
- Used a 3x3 initial infection area to ensure the event has immediate visual impact
- Implemented transformation checks in both DudeNotFull and DudeFull to ensure all dude types are affected
- Used distance-based detection for transformations to create area-of-effect behavior
- Created simple but distinctive pixel art sprites to clearly differentiate the infected entities
